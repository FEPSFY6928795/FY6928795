   Wearable medical devices have become an integral componenet of modern healthcare, particularly for the managment of chronic conditions.
   Advances in material science and microelectronics have contributed to devices that can continuously monitor physiological activity to 
   improve patient outcomes, reducing clinical workload, and enhancing quality of life for individuals with long term illnesses. These technologies
   enable real time monitoring, which allows clinicians to detect changes in patient health early and intervene more effectively. The adoption
   of wearable devices presents practical challenges, including device comfort, durability, data reliability and patient adherence. This paper
   examines the design considerations for wearable health technologies, evaluates their applications and limitations and discusses the future 
   direction for wider implementation.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
    The integration of wearable medical technology is rapidly changing how chronic diseases are monitored and mangaged. One of the most
    prevalent uses of these devices is in diabetes management, where continuous monitoring and automated delivery systems support treatment, but
    the same approach applies across many other long term conditions. As these devices become more established in clinical practice, their design
    needs have become more complex, requiring a balance of precision and ease of use. Meeting these demands involves a careful understanding of
    the materials and ergonomic factors that determine perfomance in real world settings.

     Wearable medical devices must achieve a balance between functionailty and patient comfort. Devices intended for continuous daily use must
     remain lightweight and unobtrusive, while being capable of housing essential components. Accurate data collection is particularly important
     during physical activity, as exposure to sweat, dirt and temperature fluctuations may interfere with performance, this makes material selection
     a key design consideration. Biocompatible materials that minimise skin irritation such as medical grade silcone and hydrogels allow the device
     to conform to the body without compromising performance. Hydrogels are soft, water-swollen polymer networds that are widely used in wearable
     medical devices. Their hydrophilic polymer systems allow them to closely match the elasticity of biological tissues, providing comfort and 
     minimising irritation during continous use (Zhang et al., 2023a). Hydrogels aslo exhibit high deformability, enabling them to conform to 
     complex body surfaces without compromising sensor performance (Zhang et al., 2023b). Another important factor is the aesthetic design, devices
     that are discrete and unobtrusive reduce self-consciousnes which improves patient adherence to wearing the monitor.

     Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and insulin pumps show how transformative wearable devices are to chronic disease management. CGMs provide
     continuous glucose measurements, allowing clinicians to identify patterns such as overnight hypoglycaemia and post-meal spikes, enabling precise
     adjustments to the treatment. When integrated with insulin pumps, these devices form a closed loop system: glucose readings determine the insulin 
     dose and the resulting glucose response guides future treatment. Clinical studies demonstrate that CGM use improves glycaemic control compared 
     with traditional self-monitoring, with real time CGMs providing the greatest benefits. (weisman et al., 2017).

     Successful use of CGMs and pumps requires organised data, as well as patient education. Clinicians must be able to identify trends without being 
     overwhelmed by raw data, while patients and caregivers require guidance on how to interprate readings (Dovc et al., 2023). These technologies can 
     reduce hospital admissions and emergency interventions, decreasing the burden on health services. The effectiveness the of treatment depends on 
     sustained patient engagement, as irregular use limits the benefits. Socioeconomic factors and limited digital literacy may furhter restrict access,
     this limits the benefits of these devices. Comprehensive training and support and essential to ensure successful adoption
     of these devices.

     Future imporvemnts in wearable devives requires advances in sensor materials and miniturisation, and potentially AI-based predictive analytics. 
     Integration with personlised medicine and AI-based algorithms may enable more accurate gluocse predictions. Implementing AI requires careful
     consideration of patient safety and ethical concerns. Ensuring transparency in algorithmic decision making and maintaining human oversight are 
     crucial for patient safety (Boudi et al., 2024). It is essential that AI is implemented responsibly so that it can be widely adopted safely.

     Wearable medical devices offer significant potential for improving chrnoic disease managment through personalised care and responsive treatment. 
     Delivering these benefits requires careful engineering considerations and software design and implementation. Collaboration between engineers and 
     clinicians is essential to advance wearable medical technology so that it is poised to support personalised and data driven healthcare.
